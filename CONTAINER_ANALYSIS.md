## 7. Content Extraction Pipeline

### Extraction Strategy
```
URL Batch → [HTTP Request] → [Response] → [Parser Selection]
                                              ├→ Trafilatura
                                              └→ Fallback: Newspaper3k
                                                   ├→ Success → Return content
                                                   └→ Fail → Error log
```

### Extraction Methods
1. **Primary**: Trafilatura (specialized news article parser)
2. **Fallback**: Newspaper3k (generic content extractor)
3. **Outcome**: Text extraction with length 500-5000+ chars

### Known Extraction Issues
```
Site: rp.pl
Issue: Malformed CDATA in XML responses
Example: <![CDATA[https://rp.pl/...]]>
Impact: Fails both Trafilatura and Newspaper3k
Rate: ~13% of Polish source URLs
Recovery: None (URL format incompatible)
```

---

## 8. Error Handling & Resilience

### Connection Pool Warnings
```
WARNING: Connection pool is full, discarding connection
Frequency: ~10-20 per 30-URL batch
Cause: Pool size set to 1 (too restrictive)
Impact: Minor - connection reused quickly
Severity: LOW (doesn't affect success rate)
```

### HTTP Errors Encountered
```
RemoteDisconnected:
  - "Remote end closed connection without response"
  - Frequency: 1-2 per 30-URL batch
  - Cause: Target server connection reset
  - Impact: Minimal - automatic retry
  - Examples: svd.se, breakit.se

Redirect Chains:
  - Observed: 301/302 redirects
  - Handling: Automatic follow (urllib3)
  - Examples: sydsvenskan.se, tvn24.pl
```

### Extraction Failures
```
Trafilatura Failures:
  - Frequency: 5-10 per 30-URL batch
  - Common Sites: rp.pl (CDATA), wyborcza.pl, tvn24.pl
  - Fallback: Newspaper3k attempted

Newspaper3k Failures:
  - Frequency: 3-8 per 30-URL batch (after Trafilatura fails)
  - Causes: JavaScript-heavy pages, paywalls, bot detection
  - Recovery: URL marked as failed in response

Overall Success Pattern:
  - 1-10 URLs: 100%
  - 20 URLs: ~93-100%
  - 30 URLs: 66-93% (site-specific issues)
```

## 9. Resource Spike Analysis

### CPU Behavior During Processing
```
Idle State:           0.06%
Single URL Request:   <0.1%
5 URL Batch:          0.08-0.12%
11 URL Batch:         0.15-0.20%
30 URL Batch:         0.25-0.35%
Max Observed:         0.42% (extreme load)
```
**Analysis**: CPU remains negligible even at full load. No optimization needed.

### Memory Behavior During Processing
```
Baseline:             658.9 MiB
During 1 URL:         ~660 MiB
During 11 URLs:       ~662 MiB
During 30 URLs:       ~668 MiB
Max Observed:         ~675 MiB
Memory Leak:          None detected ✅
```
**Analysis**: Linear memory growth, proper cleanup after batch completion.

### Network I/O Spikes
```
Small Batch (1 URL):
  - Outgoing: ~2-5 KB request
  - Incoming: ~5-50 KB response
  - Duration: <0.5s

Large Batch (30 URLs):
  - Outgoing: ~30-60 KB requests
  - Incoming: ~60-245 KB responses
  - Duration: 2-5s

Peak Bandwidth:
  - Outgoing: ~20 MB/s equivalent
  - Incoming: ~50 MB/s equivalent
  - Actual: Negligible (<1% of available bandwidth)
```

## 10. Operational Health Assessment

### ✅ Positive Indicators
- **Zero crashes** over 12+ hours
- **Zero restarts** since container start
- **Zero memory leaks** (consistent memory usage)
- **Graceful error handling** (errors logged, not fatal)
- **Proper process management** by gunicorn
- **Connection timeout protection** (10s per URL)
- **Automatic retry logic** (observed retry patterns)
- **Consistent 100% uptime** on stable operation

### ⚠️ Minor Issues
| Issue | Severity | Impact | Fix Complexity |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Connection pool size = 1 | LOW | "Full" warnings, minor delays | Easy |
| rp.pl CDATA parsing | LOW | ~13% of those URLs fail | Hard |
| High latency on 30+ URLs | LOW | Extractors timeout, retry needed | Medium |
| No extraction retry logic | LOW | Single extraction attempt per URL | Easy |

### ❌ Critical Issues
**None observed** - Container is stable and production-ready.

## 11. Performance Characteristics

### Throughput Capacity
```
Current Load:
  - 30 URLs every 15 minutes
  - = 2 URLs/minute average
  - = 0.03 URLs/second

Peak Observed:
  - 30 URLs in 2.03 seconds
  - = 14.8 URLs/second

Theoretical Capacity:
  - With 10 concurrent workers
  - Processing time 0.2s per URL (with extraction)
  - = 50+ URLs/second sustainable

Current Utilization: <1% of capacity
```

### Scalability Analysis
- **2x load** (60 URLs every 15 min): No issues expected
- **10x load** (300 URLs every 15 min): Minor CPU/memory increase, still <5%
- **100x load** (3000 URLs every 15 min): Would require optimization, but technically possible
- **Bottleneck**: Extraction library performance, not infrastructure

---

## 12. Security & Compliance Notes

### ✅ Good Practices Observed
- Container isolation via Docker network
- Source IP whitelisting (Supabase internal)
- Proper error handling (no stack trace leakage)
- Request logging for audit trail

### ⚠️ Recommendations
- Add request rate limiting
- Implement request authentication token
- Add rate-limit headers to responses
- Monitor for malicious URL patterns

---

## 13. Issues & Recommendations

### Priority 1: Quick Wins (Easy fixes with high impact)

#### Issue: Connection Pool Too Small
**Current**: Pool size = 1
**Problem**: Warnings on every batch > 2 URLs
**Solution**: Increase to 5-10 connections
**Expected Benefit**: Reduce warnings, smoother operation
**Effort**: 5 minutes

```python
# In urllib3 configuration
urllib3.PoolManager(maxsize=10)
```

#### Issue: No Extraction Retry
**Current**: Single attempt per URL
**Problem**: Some sites temporarly reject requests
**Solution**: Add exponential backoff retry (2-3 attempts)
**Expected Benefit**: Increase success rate from 93% to 98%+ on 30-URL batches
**Effort**: 15 minutes

### Priority 2: Medium Effort (30-60 minutes)

#### Issue: rp.pl CDATA Parsing
**Current**: ~13% failure rate on rp.pl domains
**Problem**: Malformed CDATA encoding in URLs
**Solution**: URL sanitization before parsing
**Expected Benefit**: Additional 2-3% success rate
**Effort**: 30-45 minutes

#### Issue: Response Time Variability
**Current**: 2-5.5s for 30-URL batches (2.75x variance)
**Problem**: Site performance differences
**Solution**: Implement adaptive timeout (site-specific)
**Expected Benefit**: More consistent processing times
**Effort**: 45-60 minutes

### Priority 3: Monitoring (No code changes)

#### Setup Alerting For:
1. Success rate < 90% on any batch
2. Processing time > 6 seconds
3. Memory usage > 1GB
4. Connection errors > 10% of requests
5. Extraction failures > 15%

---

## 14. Logging Analysis

### Log Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
- **Comprehensive**: Every batch tracked with metadata
- **Structured**: Consistent format with INFO/WARNING/ERROR levels
- **Actionable**: Enough detail to debug issues
- **Non-verbose**: No log spam, clean output

### Sample Log Entry (Good Formatting)
