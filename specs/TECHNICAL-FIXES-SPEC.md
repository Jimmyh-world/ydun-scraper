## Implementation Plan (Jimmy's Workflow)

Follow RED→GREEN→CHECKPOINT for each fix.

## Fix 1: CDATA URL Wrapping (30% Failure Rate)

### 🔴 RED: Implementation

**Problem:**
Edge function sends URLs wrapped in CDATA tags: `<![CDATA[URL]]>`

**Error:**
```
No connection adapters were found for ':/<![CDATA[https:/www.rp.pl/...]]>'
```

**Impact:** 30% failure rate in affected batches (Polish news sites)

**File:** `src/article_extractor.py`

**Changes Required:**

Add URL sanitization function (defensive programming):

```python
import re

def sanitize_url(url: str) -> str:
    """
    Remove CDATA wrapping and other XML artifacts if present

    Args:
        url: Raw URL string (may contain CDATA tags)

    Returns:
        Clean URL string

    Examples:
        '<![CDATA[https://example.com]]>' → 'https://example.com'
        'https://example.com' → 'https://example.com' (unchanged)
    """
    if not url:
        return url

    # Strip CDATA tags
    cleaned = re.sub(r'<!\[CDATA\[(.*?)\]\]>', r'\1', url)

    # Strip any leading/trailing whitespace
    cleaned = cleaned.strip()

    # Log if we had to clean
    if cleaned != url:
        logger.info(f"Sanitized URL: {url} → {cleaned}")

    return cleaned
```

**Integration Points:**

1. In `extract_article()` function (before any processing):
```python
def extract_article(url: str, method: str = 'trafilatura') -> dict:
    """Extract article content from URL"""

    # Sanitize URL first (defense against CDATA wrapping)
    url = sanitize_url(url)

    # Rest of extraction logic...
```

2. In `ArticleExtractor.extract()` method (if exists):
```python
def extract(self, url: str, **kwargs) -> dict:
    """Extract article with all compliance checks"""

    # Sanitize URL
    url = sanitize_url(url)

    # Rest of method...
```

**Following Principles:**
- **KISS:** Simple regex, clear function
- **Fix Now:** Defensive programming even if edge function is fixed
- **DRY:** Single sanitization function used everywhere

### 🟢 GREEN: Validation

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Unit test for URL sanitization
pytest tests/test_url_sanitization.py -v

# Test with CDATA-wrapped URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"urls": ["<![CDATA[https://www.dn.se/]]>"]}'

# Expected: Should extract successfully (CDATA stripped)

# Test with normal URL (no regression)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"urls": ["https://www.svd.se/"]}'

# Expected: Should work as before

# Test with problematic Polish URLs from logs
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"urls": ["https://www.rp.pl/spadki-i-darowizny/test"]}'

# Expected: Should extract successfully
```

**Add Unit Tests:**

Create `tests/test_url_sanitization.py`:
```python
import pytest
from src.article_extractor import sanitize_url

class TestURLSanitization:
    """Test URL sanitization removes CDATA wrapping"""

    def test_sanitize_cdata_wrapped_url(self):
        """Test CDATA tags are removed"""
        dirty = '<![CDATA[https://example.com/article]]>'
        clean = sanitize_url(dirty)
        assert clean == 'https://example.com/article'

    def test_sanitize_clean_url_unchanged(self):
        """Test clean URLs pass through unchanged"""
        url = 'https://example.com/article'
        result = sanitize_url(url)
        assert result == url

    def test_sanitize_whitespace_stripped(self):
        """Test whitespace is stripped"""
        dirty = '  https://example.com/article  '
        clean = sanitize_url(dirty)
        assert clean == 'https://example.com/article'

    def test_sanitize_nested_cdata(self):
        """Test nested or multiple CDATA tags"""
        dirty = '<![CDATA[<![CDATA[https://example.com]]>]]>'
        clean = sanitize_url(dirty)
        assert 'CDATA' not in clean
        assert 'https://' in clean

    def test_sanitize_empty_string(self):
        """Test empty string handling"""
        result = sanitize_url('')
        assert result == ''

    def test_sanitize_none_handling(self):
        """Test None handling"""
        result = sanitize_url(None)
        assert result is None
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] sanitize_url() function implemented
- [ ] Integrated at all URL entry points
- [ ] Unit tests passing (6+ tests)
- [ ] CDATA-wrapped test URL extracts successfully
- [ ] Clean URLs still work (no regression)
- [ ] Logging shows CDATA stripping when it occurs

### 🔵 CHECKPOINT

## Fix 2: Connection Pool Exhaustion (507 Warnings)

### 🔴 RED: Implementation

**Problem:**
Connection pool size = 1 per domain, causing pool exhaustion with concurrent requests.

**Metrics:**
- 507 warnings from urllib3.connectionpool
- Affects all high-volume domains

**Impact:** Connections discarded → performance degradation, potential timeouts

**File:** `src/batch_scraper.py` or `src/article_extractor.py`

**Changes Required:**

**Following KISS: Use requests.Session() with proper adapter**

Add session management:

```python
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry

def create_session_with_pool(pool_size: int = 20) -> requests.Session:
    """
    Create requests session with connection pooling

    Args:
        pool_size: Maximum connections per domain (default: 20)

    Returns:
        Configured requests.Session with connection pooling
    """
    session = requests.Session()

    # Configure retry strategy
    retry_strategy = Retry(
        total=2,
        status_forcelist=[429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
        allowed_methods=["HEAD", "GET", "OPTIONS"],
        backoff_factor=1
    )

    # Configure adapter with connection pooling
    adapter = HTTPAdapter(
        pool_connections=10,  # Number of connection pools to cache
        pool_maxsize=pool_size,  # Max connections per pool
        max_retries=retry_strategy
    )

    session.mount("http://", adapter)
    session.mount("https://", adapter)

    # Add User-Agent
    session.headers.update({
        'User-Agent': USER_AGENT
    })

    return session
```

**Integration:**

1. In `ArticleExtractor` class or module-level:
```python
# Create shared session for connection pooling
_session = create_session_with_pool(pool_size=20)

def extract_article(url: str, method: str = 'trafilatura') -> dict:
    """Extract article using shared session for connection pooling"""

    # Use session for all HTTP requests
    # trafilatura.fetch_url() might not use session directly,
    # but we can use session for initial checks and fallbacks

    # For custom requests:
    response = _session.get(url, timeout=30)
    html = response.text

    # Then extract with trafilatura from HTML
    extracted = trafilatura.extract(html, ...)
```

2. Update newspaper3k usage to use session:
```python
# If using newspaper3k
article = Article(url)
# Can't directly use session with newspaper3k,
# but reducing concurrency (already done) helps
```

**Alternative (Simpler):**

Since concurrency is now 3 (down from 10), connection pool might be less critical. But increasing pool size is still best practice:

```python
# In requests calls (if not using session):
from urllib3 import PoolManager

# Configure urllib3 directly
import urllib3
http = urllib3.PoolManager(
    maxsize=20,
    block=False,
    retries=urllib3.Retry(3)
)
```

**Following KISS:** Use requests.Session() approach - cleaner, more maintainable.

### 🟢 GREEN: Validation

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Monitor connection pool before fix
docker logs ydun-scraper 2>&1 | grep "Connection pool is full" | wc -l
# Baseline: Should be high number

# Send high-volume batch (same domain)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "urls": [
      "https://www.svd.se/article1",
      "https://www.svd.se/article2",
      "https://www.svd.se/article3",
      "https://www.svd.se/article4",
      "https://www.svd.se/article5"
    ]
  }'

# Monitor connection pool after fix
docker logs ydun-scraper --since 5m 2>&1 | grep "Connection pool is full" | wc -l

# Expected: 0 or very few warnings

# Check if connections are being reused
docker logs ydun-scraper --since 5m | grep -i "connection"

# Expected: Should show connection reuse, not constant new connections
```

**Performance Test:**
```bash
# Benchmark before/after
time curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @tests/test-urls-10-same-domain.json

# Expected: Similar or better performance, fewer warnings
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Session with connection pooling implemented
- [ ] Pool size increased to 20
- [ ] All HTTP requests use session
- [ ] Connection pool warnings reduced 90%+ (507 → <50)
- [ ] No performance regression
- [ ] High-volume same-domain test succeeds

### 🔵 CHECKPOINT

**Deliverables:**
- Session management implemented
- Connection pooling configured (pool_size=20)
- Tests passing
- Connection pool warnings drastically reduced

**Rollback Procedure:**
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
docker compose restart ydun-scraper
# Time to rollback: 2 minutes
```

## Code Examples Summary

### URL Sanitization (Defense-in-Depth)

```python
def sanitize_url(url: str) -> str:
    """Remove CDATA wrapping and whitespace"""
    if not url:
        return url

    import re
    cleaned = re.sub(r'<!\[CDATA\[(.*?)\]\]>', r'\1', url)
    cleaned = cleaned.strip()

    if cleaned != url:
        logger.info(f"Sanitized URL: {url} → {cleaned}")

    return cleaned
```

### Connection Pooling (KISS Approach)

```python
def create_session_with_pool(pool_size: int = 20) -> requests.Session:
    """Create session with connection pooling"""
    session = requests.Session()

    adapter = HTTPAdapter(
        pool_connections=10,
        pool_maxsize=pool_size,
        max_retries=Retry(total=2, backoff_factor=1)
    )

    session.mount("http://", adapter)
    session.mount("https://", adapter)
    session.headers.update({'User-Agent': USER_AGENT})

    return session

# Module-level shared session
_session = create_session_with_pool(20)
```

---

## Principles Applied

**KISS:** Simple regex for CDATA, requests.Session() for pooling
**TDD:** Unit tests written for both fixes
**Fix Now:** Addressing identified issues immediately
**DRY:** Shared session reused across all requests
**YAGNI:** Not adding features - fixing identified problems only

---

## Orchestrator Approval Gate

**After Beast completes implementation, Orchestrator will:**

1. Pull changes from GitHub
2. Review code quality
3. Verify test coverage
4. Check documentation updates
5. Approve or request iteration
