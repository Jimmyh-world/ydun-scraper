### ✅ Technical Fixes (COMPLETE - 2025-10-19)

**Status:** 2/2 issues resolved

**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ CDATA URL wrapping (30% failure → 0%)

## Deployment Strategy Discussion (2025-10-19)

### Context

**Current State:**
- ydun-scraper works for customer's pipeline
- Running on Beast (development/testing)
- Needs to deploy to customer's Render account (production)

**Key Question:** How to structure for dual deployment (Beast dev + Render production)?

---

### Decision Points Under Review

**1. Repository Strategy**

**✅ DECIDED: Single Repo, Multiple Deploy Targets**
```
ydun-scraper/ (one repo)
├── src/                      # Same code everywhere
├── Dockerfile                # Works for Beast Docker + Render
├── render.yaml               # ADD THIS - Render deployment config
├── docs/
│   ├── DEPLOY-BEAST.md       # ADD THIS - Beast deployment guide
│   └── DEPLOY-RENDER.md      # ADD THIS - Render deployment guide
```

**Reasoning:**
- ✅ **DRY** - Code maintained in one place
- ✅ **KISS** - Simpler than managing separate repos
- ✅ **SOC** - Code vs deployment config properly separated
- ✅ Bug fixes benefit both deployments automatically

**Rejected:** Separate customer repo (violates DRY, maintenance burden)

---

**2. Container Registry Strategy**

**Option A: GitHub Container Registry - ghcr.io (RECOMMENDED)**

**Flow:**
```
GitHub Actions (automated):
1. Build Docker image on push to main
2. Push to ghcr.io/jimmyh-world/ydun-scraper
3. Tag with version/commit SHA

Customer Deployment:
1. Render pulls: ghcr.io/jimmyh-world/ydun-scraper:latest
2. Customer configures via Render environment variables
3. Render runs container
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **FREE** (GitHub Container Registry for public/private images)
- ✅ No infrastructure to maintain (vs self-hosted)
- ✅ High availability (GitHub's infrastructure)
- ✅ Integrated with GitHub Actions (automated builds)
- ✅ Customer pulls pre-built image (no build tools needed)
- ✅ You control versions and updates
- ✅ Source code protected (customer gets image, not code - if desired)

**Option B: Self-Hosted Registry on Beast**
- Full control, but infrastructure overhead
- Need to secure, backup, maintain
- Bandwidth considerations
- **Assessment:** More complex than needed (violates KISS)

**Option C: No Registry (Build on Deploy)**
- Customer builds from source
- Slower deployments
- Customer needs GitHub access + build tools
- **Assessment:** Unnecessary complexity for customer

**Current Thinking:** Use GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)

---

**3. CI/CD Pipeline (Proposed Phases)**

**Phase 1: Automated Testing**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
on: [push, pull_request]
- Run pytest on every commit
- Validate legal compliance tests
- Report coverage
```
**Why:** Catch bugs immediately (Fix Now principle), validate compliance

**Phase 2: Container Build & Push**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
on: [push to main]
- Build Docker image
- Run tests in container
- Push to ghcr.io
- Tag with version + commit SHA
```
**Why:** Automated, consistent images for customer

**Phase 3: Auto-Deploy (Optional)**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- Deploy to Beast (if desired)
- Notify Render to pull new image
```
**Why:** Full automation (evaluate if needed)

---

**4. Unresolved Questions**

**Beast Auto-Deploy:**
- 🤔 Keep manual control (current)?
- 🤔 Or automate (deploy on every push)?
- **Leaning:** Manual for now (you control Beast updates)

**Customer Access Model:**
- 🤔 Give customer GitHub repo access (transparency, can fork)?
- 🤔 Or just Docker images (black box approach)?
- **Leaning:** Image-only via ghcr.io (cleaner separation)

**Version Management:**
- 🤔 Tag semantic versions (v1.0.0, v1.1.0)?
- 🤔 Or just latest tag?
- 🤔 Should customer pin versions or auto-update?
- **Needs decision**
